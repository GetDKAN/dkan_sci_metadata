## 2.1.2 - 2018-04-18

* bugfix for issue [49](https://github.com/seboettg/citeproc-php/issues/49): Stylesheets that used the ``text-case="title"`` option, in combination with some in Slavic (or Serbo-Croatian) language, caused errors that destroyed the entire output.

## 2.1.1 - 2018-02-08
* Support for render variables that are using "-short" suffixes, if Text tags have a "form" attribute which is set to "short": ``<text form="short" .../>``.

Have a look at issue [47](https://github.com/seboettg/citeproc-php/issues/47).

## 2.1.0 - 2017-11-23

* possibility to use custom Lambda functions to enrich bibliographies and citations with additional HTML markup. Have a look [here](https://github.com/seboettg/citeproc-php/blob/master/README.md#advanced-usage-of-citeproc-php).
